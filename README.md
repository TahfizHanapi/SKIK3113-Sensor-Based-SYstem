Idea: The system will monitor the egg environment to produce the best egg product. The DHT22 will measure the temperature and humidity of the egg/egg container. At the same time, the ultrasonic will detect if any obstacles/animals/bugs can destroy the egg. For normal conditions, the green LED will light on and the other output components will remain turned off. If there are any obstacles detected nearly 10cm from the ultrasonic, the system will trigger the triggerAlert functions where the green LED will turn off, the red LED will light on, and the servo will move 180 degrees to get rid of the obstacles/animals and the buzzer will turn on to give alert to the monitor/owner.


Additional Features: Adding the real time sensor to get the real time data by using the Real Time Censor (RTC) and the Firebase software may increase the effectiveness of the system. Temperature, humidity, and distance readings from sensors would all be continuously streamed to the Firebase real-time database by the system. A web or mobile application would communicate with the Firebase database by connecting and continuously listening for updates. The program would get instant updates when fresh sensor data is written to the database, allowing users to keep an eye on the environmental conditions surrounding the eggs in real-time. Users get real-time insights into the incubation environment because of Firebase's real-time synchronization, which makes sure that changes in sensor data are mirrored instantly across all linked clients. Furthermore, the monitoring interface might be secured by implementing Firebase Authentication, which would only permit authorized users to view the real-time data.
